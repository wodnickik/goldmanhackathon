## main problem

We came to the conclusion that one of the issues for potential candidates might be overwhelming amount of information they get when trying to apply. Candidate has to go through several pages, every one of them with a lot of potentialy important info. It might also be hard to navigate to the right tab where you can finnaly apply for a job. Additionally, job titles and descriptions might be confusing for people looking for their first job.

## solution

We propose building additional site which would be shared at events. It would have all of the open position in one place and minimize number of clicks necessary to apply. Moreover it could use recommendation system that might highlight positions based on information about candidate.
